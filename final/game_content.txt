# name|description
A Mysterious Room|You wake in an old room. Cobwebs coat the corners of the room and tops of doorways. You see doors surrounding you; and sword lays sharp near your feet.
A Small Closet|This closet barely holds anything. A shield hangs on the wall, though it seems it won't stay there long.
The Library|The room is lined with bookshelves. Books of all shapes and colors seem to have been left here to collect dust it seems.
The Hallroom|The ceiling is decorated with muted paint and the walls are filled with old looking portraits.
The Courtyard|There's a dirt path surrounding a large old tree. It seems to have lost it's leaves a long while ago.
Storage Room|This room is packed with shelves. Though it's so disorganized, the items are impossible to distinguish.
The Arena|A massive clearing opens with tall walls and seats surrounding you. There is only one path forward.
The Royal Hall|A red velvet carpet lines the walkway ahead. Purple banners hang from the wall. And there seems to be a strange small door.
Secret Room|The room is bigger than you expected, full of monsters, and a strange chest sits in the back of the room.
Throne Room|A large throne carved from wood and adorned with gold is placed in the middle of this room. Behind it, seems to be daylight.
The Knights Hall|This hall is full of weapons and armor, though each item is rusted and well used.
The Barracks|Beds line the walls leaving very little room to move. 
The Royal Quarters|A large bed sits in the center of the room. There was once a veil of curtains, but they seem to have become one with the bed.
The Connector Hall|This hall connects the bedroom wing of this place.
The Bathroom|There's almost nothing here, just a wash basin. There's a book on the ground.
The Bedroom|This bedroom hasn't been touched. The bed is absent of sheets or any sense of use. Though a journal lays at the foot of it. There's a small door in the corner.
The Hidden Room|Uncovering this room leads to more cobwebs. Though they've completely buried a small key in a mountain of webbing.
