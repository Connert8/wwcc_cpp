# [Broken Dream]

## How to Play

To play, enter the promted keys. Make sure it's either numbers on their own, or lowercase letters.

## Story Synopsis

You wake in a mysterious room. All memory of getting there is absent. Your objective is to find answers and to escape alive.

## Controls

There is a control menu that pops up when needed. The controls will all be entered numbers.

## Features Implemented

I used every feature required. The only features where I went above and beyond were the scope of the game (17 rooms instead of 4), and using pointers in ways beyond the class.

## File Structure

- final_main.cpp: Main game logic
- game_content.txt: Story content and descriptions


## Challenges Faced

There were a ton of challenges with this program. The biggest by far was making the map system work properly. I used ai (where labeled) to aid in using pointers. Eventually I got a system to work, where the player's room is properly tracked and one can progress through the map.
Another big challenge was combat. The combat is unfinished, though not below assignment requirements. I was quite ambitous for this and the ten days I had were not quite enough for my ideas. 
Also, spending time working through these challenges proved too much to expand on my ideas more. I got faster as time went on, but problem solving definately took the most time.

## Future Improvements

I would for sure organize this program much more than what I am submitting. It started very clean and understandable, although as time went on and the deadline approached, I wasn't able to keep it as clean as it could have been.
With more time, I would make the combat system more refined. This includes making health potions available, working shield and armor, and a parry system. The player could select parry and get a chance to inflict a garanteed critical hit if the parry landed.
Also, I would organize the code a lot more. It changed so much and so fast that getting it into seperate files was difficult to do in time.
Finally, I would add the saving and loading feature. While this program works just fine, restarting every time can be tedious.
